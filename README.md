# Pathfinding Visualizer
This application is a GUI that visualizes simple pathfinding/search algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, A*. Users are able to move around the start and target nodes, and create obstacles to block paths. It is written in Java and uses the JavaFX 11 platform.



### Creating Obstacles
Obstacles can be created by clicking and dragging the cursor across the grid.

### Moving Nodes
The start and target node can be moved around by clicking them and dragging them around.

### Search Algorithms
Users are able to run the BFS (breadth-first search) and DFS (depth-first search) algorithms.
