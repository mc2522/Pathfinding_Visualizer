# Pathfinding_Visualizer
This application is a GUI that visualizes simple pathfinding/search algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, A*. Users are able to move around the start and target nodes, and create obstacles to block paths.

## Creating obstacles
Users can drag their mouse across the grid to create obstacles.
